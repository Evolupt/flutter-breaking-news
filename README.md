# flutter_breaking_news

 <img src="doc/flutter-firebase.png" alt="drawing" width="100"/>

Another Flutter Open Source project.

The application will display the breaking news using [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

## App Screenshot

Here are some screenshots of the running application :

## Technologies

###  1. **Flutter Flavors**:

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/flavor.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
</p>

It is a good practice to build separate apps for different environment ( dev, prod, ...).
In case of mobile apps , the best way to have these separate configurations is usage of **flavors**

The concept of flavors is taken from Android apps and can be applied to iOS using **schemes**.

Thanks to [Dominik Roszkowski](https://github.com/orestesgaolin) for the wonderful guide that helps me 
setup Flavors in Flutter : 
 
- [Flavors in Flutter with Fastlane ](https://roszkowski.dev/2019/flutter-flavors/)

In the code , I've implemented 3 flavors : **dev**, **qa**, **prod**

<br/>

### 2. **Fastlane**:

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/fastlane.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
</p>


I used [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to automate apps deployments to QA environment. 


See my `faslane/` folder for more

<br/>

### 3. **Firebase App Distribution**:

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/firebase-app-distribution.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
</p>


[Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) is my QA environment.
I am using the [fastlane plugin for Firebase App Distribution](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane-plugin-firebase_app_distribution) 
to distribute apps to trusted testers.

Following is a sample fastlane code use in the project to to deploy the android version of the app to Firebase App Distribution

        firebase_app_distribution(
            app: ENV["FIREBASE_ANDROID_TEST_APP_ID"],
            firebase_cli_token: ENV["FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN"],
            apk_path: "build/app/outputs/apk/qa/release/app-qa-release.apk",
            release_notes_file: "distribution/release-notes.txt",
            testers_file:  "distribution/testers.txt"
        )

See my `faslane/` and `distribution/` folders for more

<br/>

### 4. **Codemagic**:

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/codemagic-flutter.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
</p>

[Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/) offers me the possibility to implement **CI/CD**. It starts with my git repository hosted on **Gitlab**. 


My secret keys to connect to Firebase are not save inside the repository. So I am using Codemagic environments variables 
and **post-clone** step to generate all the keys I need to build the project. 

Following is a sample way to generate key in a post-clone codemagic step 

    echo "--- Generate Google Service key for Android"
    GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_PATH="$FCI_BUILD_DIR/android/app/google-services.json"
    echo $GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64 | base64 --decode > $GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_PATH
    
See my `codemagic/` folder for more


### 5. **Codecov**:

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/codecov.png" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
</p>

Well, it is nice to test your flutter code , but it is better to have to setup the code coverage. 

I am testing the application with the following command : 

    
        $> flutter test --coverage
        
 And I am using [codecov](https://codecov.io/) for my coverage reports.



## Code & Design Patterns

###  1. **BLOC**:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/docs/assets/bloc_architecture.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>
</p>


BLoC a.k.a **Business Logic Components** is a design pattern presented by Paolo Soares and Cong hui, from Google at the DartConf 2018.

So I used Bloc, for the **state management** of the application. This design pattern helps to separate presentation from business logic.

I am using the well know [bloc library](https://github.com/felangel/bloc) for Dart & Flutter in this project.

### 2. JSON using code generation libraries 

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/flutter-serialize.png" alt="drawing" width="250"/>
</p>


I am big fan of code generation when it comes to consuming API data. According to the official documentation about [JSON and Serialization](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json)

I am using **json_annotation** + **json_serializable** to retrieve news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

### 3. Authentication

<p align="center">
<img src="doc/firebase-google-signin.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>
</p>

The auth process is handle serveless way with Google Cloud project named **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**. 
To sign in the application, you must sign in with a **google account**. 


## How to use

### 1. Setup Firebase 

As mentionned in the [Firebase doc](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/google-android#migrate_your_console_project):

>Firebase manages all of your API settings and credentials through a single configuration file.
The file is named google-services.json on Android and GoogleService-Info.plist on iOS.

It makes that my .gitignore will exclude **google-services.json** and **GoogleService-Info.plist**

Follow the firebase documentation to create your project and add files with the following path : 

- $PROJECT-DIR/ios/Runner/**GoogleService-Info.plist**
- $PROJECT-DIR/android/app/**google-services.json**

My package named are : 

- for Android : **com.stacklabs.flutter_breaking_news**
- for iOS: **com.stacklabs.FlutterBreakingNews**

So, feel free to fork the projet and adapt as you like. 

### 2. Run or Build the application : 

- To run the app ( FLAVOR can be `dev`, `qa` or  `prod`)


        $> FLAVOR=dev && flutter run  --flavor $FLAVOR -t lib/main_$FLAVOR.dart
    
- To build the app ( FLAVOR can be `dev`, `qa` or  `prod`)    

        
        $> flutter build apk --release \
                            -t lib/main_$FLAVOR.dart \
                            --build-name=$BUILD_NAME \
                            --build-number=$BUILD_NUMBER \
                            --flavor $FLAVOR

   or 
        
        $> flutter build ios --no-codesign  --release \
                             -t lib/main_$FLAVOR.dart \
                             --build-name=$BUILD_NAME \
                             --build-number=$BUILD_NUMBER \
                             --flavor $FLAVOR
